          <h2>What Is Anime?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The term anime [a·nuh·mei] is a Japanese colloquialism used as an
          abbreviation for the term “animation.” Generally in Japan, the word
          anime (anime in Japanese: アニメ) is synonymous with animation of any
          kind from anywhere. Internationally, however, anime is typically
          referred to as animation that is produced in Japan. The distinction
          between anime and cartoons is more cultural than it is technical and
          its origins date over 100 years ago.

          Anime is no different technically to the animation productions of
          Western culture. Which, if you know anything about, takes an
          incredible amount of time and work. Stories must be written,
          storyboarded, workshopped, taken into an animatic, voiced, and
          animated. This is a process that can take months and often years to
          finish. All of these projects are created from an entire studio of
          artists typically led by a director. This video covers the workflows
          from various animation studios and just how intensive it is to create
          animated work.
