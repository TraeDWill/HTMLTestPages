        <h2>Why Should You Adopt?</h2>
        <p>
          By choosing to adopt from an animal shelter, you give a second chance
          to a deserving pet and contribute to the welfare of animals in need.
          But it's not only the deep sense of fulfillment that comes from giving
          a home to an animal in need. The happiness and bond between a shelter
          pet and its adopter is truly special.

        <h2>Why Are Dogs Good Pets?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Dogs watch your back</strong>
            <p>
              One of the most practical perks of having a dog is that they’ll
              guard your home and your loved ones.Home invaders are far less
              likely to intrude on your home if they hear or see a dog present.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dogs will keep you active</strong>
            <p>
              Having a dog is good for your health as they absolutely must get
              exercise
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dogs bring you friends</strong>
            <p>
              Our society has become wary of talking to strangers in public. If
              you have a dog in your hand walking next to you, that fear totally
              goes away.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A dog can make you feel less alone</strong>
            <p>
              Dogs love being around their owners and love to please them.
              You’ll always have your dog to cuddle with, eat dinner with, or
              head to a dog-friendly bar
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dogs relieve stress</strong>
            <p>
              Petting your dog increases feelings of contentment and relaxation.
              Unlike most cats, dogs love the affection and attention of
              petting.

        <h2>How To Adopt</h2>
        <p>
          There are always local sources to look into like shelters and animal
          services. There are also biases towards certains types and ages of
          dogs as well. I recommend that in any given circumstance that whole
          heartedly going in with open arms and an open heart is the best
          approach. Your choice could change a life!
