        <h2>What Are Dogs?</h2>
        <p>
            dog, (Canis lupus familiaris), domestic mammal of the family Canidae (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and is related to foxes and jackals. The dog is one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world (the cat is the other).

        <h2>How Anime Is Made</h2>
        <p>
          Anime is no different technically to the animation productions of
          Western culture. Which, if you know anything about, takes an
          incredible amount of time and work. Stories must be written,
          storyboarded, workshopped, taken into an animatic, voiced, and
          animated. This is a process that can take months and often years to
          finish. All of these projects are created from an entire studio of
          artists typically led by a director. This video covers the workflows
          from various animation studios and just how intensive it is to create
          animated work.
