        <h2>What Are Pandas?</h2>
        <p>
          The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the
          world and considered a national treasure in China.
        </p>
        <p>
          This bear also has a special significance for WWF because it has been
          our logo since our founding in 1961.

        <h2>Where Are They Located?</h2>
        <p>
          Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of
          southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They
          must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what
          part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist
          bones that function as opposable thumbs.

        <h2>Facts About Pandas</h2>
        <p>
          A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th
          the size of its mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds,
          while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. These bears are
          excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.
